 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Rename to DetailColumnView? or keep as is?
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Also store selected index? why?
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Maybe there is a way to overflow in detail? Do some reseach. other apps overflow, so must be possible I think. Maybe best to make min-width for detail etc. simpler
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Try to figure out how detail can have compression resistance? to avoid getting too squashed? the idea is that navsplitview should manage this part. simpler that way etc
