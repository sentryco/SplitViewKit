/**
 * DebugExampleView
 * - Description: This view serves as the primary interface for the ExampleProject, orchestrating the interaction between sidebar, main content, and detail views. It manages state and navigation, ensuring a cohesive user experience across different device sizes and orientations.
 * - Note: Has an interesting NavigationWrapper (but uses de-precated API,
 *         but can be used for inspo): https://bignerdranch.com/blog/the-different-forms-of-navigation-in-swiftui/
 * - Note: We manage selection state in this implementation scope, and not in the helper splitview scope
 * - Note: I guess we manage all selection states here, as the columns can move into singular column mode in compact mode, or double etc
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Add navigation view, isn't that done?
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Try to style the list. We can style mainlist fine, but not prefsmainlist, why is that? still relevant?
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Maybe we do the prefsmain manually, and not with ListContainer, what?
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Make sure things work for iPhone and mac as well üëà
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Rename to MainView? or AppView? or is ExampleView fine? yepp keep as is
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Clearify around selected index and selected item etc. unify? its unclear atm why we have both etc
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Consider adding placeholder views when there is no selection etc (currently there is always a selection)
