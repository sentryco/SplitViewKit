 * Preview (iPad / macOS)
 * - Description: This is the bare-bone reference design for SplitViewContainer
 * - Note: Great example of SplitViewController: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77464914/navigationstack-inside-navigationsplitview-detail-in-swiftui
 * - Note: To test window resizing etc. Use simulator. There is an example xcode project that can be used for that purpouse
 * - Note: It's possible to test window resizing by using splitview in simulator. Simulator does not seem to support resizing window atm
 * - Fixme: ⚠️️ Add some custom sizes 👈
 * - Fixme: ⚠️️ Hide top bar for macOS? elaborate?
 * - Fixme: ⚠️️⚠️️⚠️️ Maybe add buttons that toggle different split-view modes? 👈 (explore how this should look first etc)
 * - Fixme: ⚠️️ Make a simple debug preview with rectangles etc that has tests for colapse toggle etc? 👈
