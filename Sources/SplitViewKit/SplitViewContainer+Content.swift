    * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Maybe somehow make a view-modifier for this geomtry reader, and TupleView to inject the views? ask coilot?
    * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è We can play with min / max / ideal etc, also consider making detail have an üëâ internal overflow üëà etc
    * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Add the toggle main / detail btn (figure out how this should look etc)
    * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Add description
    * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è This is only relevant for iOS, so we could skip the geomreader for macos üëà
