 * - Note: We can detect single column mode by checking `sizeclass == .compact`
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Consider removing this class. We can pass two params. Thats fine. Less helper code that way. Or keep it as is, we do pass more params as well, and this class has some getters that are nice to have in this scope etc?

    * - Abstract: Initializes a new instance of `SplitConfig` with customizable column visibility and preferred compact column settings, enabling fine-tuned control over the `NavigationSplitView` configuration based on device size and orientation.

    *                `NavigationSplitView` based on the current device and
    *                orientation. It adjusts between all columns visible, double

    * - Note: Required init for publc classes
    * - Parameters:
    *   - columnVisibility: Specifies the visibility of columns in the NavigationSplitView. It can be set to .all, .doubleColumn, or .singleColumn to control the number of visible columns based on the device's orientation and size.
    *   - preferredCompactColumn: Determines the primary visible column in compact mode. Options include .sidebar, .content, or .detail, allowing explicit control over which column is displayed in a compact environment.
