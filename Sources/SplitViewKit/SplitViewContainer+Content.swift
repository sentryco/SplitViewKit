    * - Note: It's also possible to do this with `.onRotation` and then toggle the two views. the clue is to load a new view. But using geomreader, there is less need for a state variable etc
    * - Note: Here is a way to track rotation change (it does not rerender view, you need geomreader for that): https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-detect-device-rotation
    * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Maybe somehow make a view-modifier for this geomtry reader, and TupleView to inject the views? ask coilot?
    * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è We can play with min / max / ideal etc, also consider making detail have an üëâ internal overflow üëà etc
    * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Add the toggle main / detail btn (figure out how this should look etc)
    * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è This is only relevant for iOS, so we could skip the geomreader for macos üëà
