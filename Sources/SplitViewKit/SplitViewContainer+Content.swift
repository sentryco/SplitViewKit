    * - Note: It's also possible to do this with `.onRotation` and then toggle the two views. the clue is to load a new view. But using geomreader, there is less need for a state variable etc
    * - Note: Here is a way to track rotation change (it does not rerender view, you need geomreader for that): https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-detect-device-rotation
    * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Maybe somehow make a view-modifier for this geomtry reader, and TupleView to inject the views? ask coilot?
    * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è We can play with min / max / ideal etc, also consider making detail have an üëâ internal overflow üëà etc
    * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Add the toggle main / detail btn (figure out how this should look etc)

    * splitViewContainer
    * - Description: This view is responsible for managing the layout of the split view container based on the device's orientation and window size. It uses a GeometryReader to dynamically adjust the views and their properties such as width and visibility.
    * - Note: The issue is that since we are in regular and move to full. the sizeclass has not changed. so no view update happens. as such we need to rely on detecting winSize change and for that we use geomreader
    * - Note: GeomReader fires when moving from 70% to full. (iPad)
    * - Note: SizeClass does not fire when moving from 70% to fullscreen.
    * - Note: We can also use geometry reader on a clear pixel, but that requires an extra state for size. unless using geomreader on entire stack has performance issues, we keep it as is
    * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Maybe toggle on OS. macOS doesn't need geomreader, skip using it in that case etc?
    * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è This is only relevant for iOS / iPad, so we could skip the geomreader for macos üëà
